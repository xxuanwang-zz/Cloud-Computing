- Try s3tester.py to see how it works (steps are given below)
- Update s3tester.py to include additional tests
- You can include point calculation as part of s3tester.py.
  Sample tests show how to do this.

Attached files:
- s3tester.py
- requirements.txt

Testing steps:

1. mkdir assignment1-grading
2. cp requirements.txt assignment1-grading/.
3. cd assignment1-grading
4. python3 -m venv venv
5. source venv/bin/activate
6. pip3 install -r requirements.txt

For each student, do following from inside assignment1-grading directory:

a. git clone repo
b. cp s3tester.py into <repo-dir>
c. cd <repo-dir>
d. python s3tester.py <student-name>
   - This will print output on the screen
e. python s3tester.py <student-name> > output.txt
   - This will save output to output.txt
f. Verify the output from output.txt to spot check for any issues with
    the test code itself. 
g. Check date of first commit (3 points):
   git log --pretty=format:"%h%x09%an%x09%ad%x09%s"
