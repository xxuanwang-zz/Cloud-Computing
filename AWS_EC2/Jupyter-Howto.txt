I followed the Document by Alex Sanchez to get jupyter running on an EC2 instance
https://medium.com/@alexjsanchez/python-3-notebooks-on-aws-ec2-in-15-mostly-easy-steps-2ec5e662c6c6

0. First launch an EC2 instance and make sure:
   a. You choose a free tier Amazon Linux OS for the AMI
   b. You open port 8888 on it where the jupyter notebook server runs

(Step0 is already done for you when choose the AMI and the security group)

1. Login to your EC2 instance using ssh:
      $ ssh -i "itegrp-key.pem" ec2-user@<Your_instance_public_dns_name>
   where <Your_instance_public_dns_name> is the IP address you got from your instance:
      $ aws ec2 describe-instances --filters Name=tag-value,Values=<YourInstanceName> | grep PublicDnsName 

2. Install anaconda which comes with jupyter
    $ wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-5.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
    $ bash Anaconda3-5.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
   Choose to add anaconda to your PATH; This will modify your .bashrc for future
   
3. Confirm it:
    $ more ~/.bashrc
   Note that the PATH is not set now though:
    $ echo $PATH
   Set it for current session:
    $ export PATH="/home/ec2-user/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"
   Confirm that it works:
    $ echo $PATH
    $ which python
    $which pip
	
4. Configure jupyter to be accessible using a password:
    $ ipython
   You are now inside ipython
    Type in the following inside ipython:
		In [1]: from IPython.lib import passwd
		In [2]: passwd()
		Enter Password: *****
		Verify Password: *****
		Out[2]: 'sha1:<a long string that has your encrypted password>'
        In [3]: exit
	Make a note of the password and the hash
	
5. Configure Jupyter/Ipython server to access your notebooks via your internet browser.
    Create a default config file: ".jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py" 
	 $ jupyter notebook --generate-config
     $ mkdir certs
     $ cd certs
     $ sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout mycert.pem -out mycert.pem
    This will create a file called "mycert.pem" inside the certs folder
    Now edit the config file
	 $ cd ..
     $ vim .jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py
	Cut-and-paste this:
	            c = get_config()

				# Kernel config
				c.IPKernelApp.pylab = 'inline'  # if you want plotting support always in your notebook

				# Notebook config
				c.NotebookApp.certfile = u'/home/ec2-user/certs/mycert.pem' #location of your certificate file
				c.NotebookApp.ip = '*'
				c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False  #so that the ipython notebook does not open up a browser by default
				c.NotebookApp.password = u'sha1:262....your hash here.........65f'  #edit this with the SHA hash that you generated
				# This is the port we opened up in the EC2 instance
				c.NotebookApp.port = 8888
	Make sure the hash is the one you saved before in step 4
	
6. Now we  are ready to run the jupyter notebook server
    $ mkdir notebooks
    $ cd notebooks
    $ jupyter notebook
	
7. Assuming your EC2's instance is running at IP address: Open this URL in Browser now:
           https://<Your_instance_public_dns_name>:8888/
    ***It is possible your browser will complain first about the site being untrusted 
	   (Follow the advanced button and add the site to your exception list)
	You will be  presented with a login screen asking you for a password. (enter the password you created in Step4 above)

You are set!!!!
