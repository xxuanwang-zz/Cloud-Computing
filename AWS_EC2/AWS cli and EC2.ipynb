    "1. Amazon Web Services is a cloud service provider that allows a user to consume different services to ease application management. \n",
    "2. AWS provides infrastructure, security, storage, networking, and other services that are useful for an application life cycle.\n",
    "3. AWS is exposed as a Web Service. This makes it very simple and easy for users to manage the services. \n",
    "4. AWS provides services as an on-demand basis. In other words, users can enroll for services according to their requirements or demands for the applications and terminate the services when they are no longer needed.\n",
    "5. AWS is located at various geographical locations, also known as regions. Users have the choice to select from any of these available geographical locations that they feel will be the most useful in terms of serving the application latency time."

    "1. Amazon EC2 is an elastic virtual server that resides under the AWS cloud environment. It provides scalable computing power for an application. \n",

    "3. EC2 insances can be based on pre-existing Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). Users can even create their own AMIs from their EC2 instance. \n",
    "4. EC2 also has the capability to auto-scale the servers up and down based on the load of existing servers in just a few minutes.\n",
